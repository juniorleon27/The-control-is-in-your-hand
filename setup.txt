# Hand Gesture Spotify Controller

Raspberry Pi Setup Guide

This project lets you control Spotify using hand gestures with a USB webcam on Raspberry Pi 4.

This system is tested and works with:

• Raspberry Pi 4
• Raspberry Pi OS
• Python 3.11
• MediaPipe 0.10.9
• OpenCV
• PyAutoGUI

Do not use Python 3.12 or 3.13. MediaPipe will not work.
if `pip3` is not working in the command line use `pip` only.

## 1. Install Raspberry Pi OS

1. Download Raspberry Pi Imager from
   [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software)

2. Insert SD card into your computer

3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager

4. Choose Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit recommended)

5. Select your SD card

6. Click Write

7. Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi and boot

Connect:

* HDMI monitor
* USB keyboard
* USB mouse
* Internet (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)

---

## 2. Open Terminal

On Raspberry Pi desktop, click the Terminal icon
or press Ctrl + Alt + T

---

## 3. Update the System

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## 4. Install Python 3.11

Check current version:

```
python3 --version
```

If it is not 3.11, install Python 3.11:

```
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3-pip -y
```

Make Python 3.11 default:

```
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11 1
```

Verify:

```
python3 --version
```

It should show Python 3.11.x

## 5. Create Project Folder

```
mkdir ~/gesture-spotify
cd ~/gesture-spotify
```

---

## 6. Copy Project Files

Put these files inside the folder:

* gesture_controller.py
* requirements.txt
* diagnostic_check.py

They should be located in:

```
/home/pi/gesture-spotify
```

---

## 7. Install Python Libraries

Install the exact working versions:

```
pip3 install opencv-python numpy pyautogui
pip3 install mediapipe==0.10.9
```

Or use:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 8. Plug in Webcam

Connect your USB webcam to the Raspberry Pi.

Check if it is detected:

```
ls /dev/video*
```

You should see `/dev/video0`

---

## 9. Test Everything

Run:

```
python3 diagnostic_check.py
```

All items should show OK.

---

## 10. Install Spotify (you can download the latest version or get the apk file)

```
curl -sS https://download.spotify.com/debian/pubkey_6224F9941A8AA6D1.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/spotify.gpg
echo "deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install spotify-client -y
```

Open Spotify from the menu.
Log in to your account.
Start playing any song.

---

## 11. Run the Gesture Controller

```
cd ~/gesture-spotify
python3 gesture_controller.py
```

A camera window will open.

Make sure Spotify is open and playing.

## 12. Gesture Controls

| Fingers | Action         |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 0 (closed hand)       | Play or Pause  |
| 1       | Play or Pause  |
| 2       | Next Track     |
| 3       | Previous Track |
| 4       | Volume Up      |
| 5       | Volume Down    |

Hold your hand steady for about 1 second.

## 13. Important Notes

• Spotify must be open and playing
• The Spotify window should be active
• Use good lighting
• Only one hand should be visible
• Keep hand about 30 to 60 cm from camera

## 14. To Stop

Press Q in the camera window
or press Ctrl + C in terminal

---

## 15. If Something Breaks

Run

```
python3 diagnostic_check.py
```

It will tell you:

* If MediaPipe is broken
* If OpenCV is missing
* If the camera is not detected
